Every agent on the screen has own neural network.

During the initialization step of population creation, each agent is assigned unique weights.

**Eventually:**
* These unique weighted agents will evaluate by their fitness functions, and selected by genetic algorithms. 
* Every generation or epoch after the first epoch, there will be choosen agents who shows successes about enclosing to apple.
* The best agents consist of areas that show the closest moves to the apple
